                                                So you're peeking at my code! Well, to further elaborate, my internships at WRO International and Event Software have also
                                            honed my communication skills in a professional setting.  At WRO International, my responsiblities included communicating with 
                                            a wide array of clients; a lot of whom were non-technical.  As someone with a technical education, it was a fun challenge to 
                                            effectively communicate the more technical aspects of our product to non-technical clients.
                                                
                                                At Event Software, I was tasked with writing user documentation for several of the company's software.  This was another great
                                            learning opportunity for myself as I started my internship with zero experience in accounting and accounting software.  I had to 
                                            quickly learn to empathize with the businesses and individuals that would use our software in order to write effective documentation.

                                                To top things off, I am fluently bilingual in Malay and English.  I am also currently learning French, after which I plan to
                                            learn Arabic to impress my girlfriend's family.

                                            skills.  As IT Consultant, my responsibilities included leading the sales team and providing feedback during the development of our
                                            Content Management System (CMS).  As IT Consultant, I met personally with clients to demonstrate our e-mail marketing system and
                                            essentially performed sales pitches.  One client gave feedback to my supervisor stating that they were impressed with my presentation
